To Do:

	+	Implement "No Duplicate Keys" logic
	+	Change database population to random of exactly 100,000 (or whatever is specified) 
	+	Implement Range search
		+	range search for Hash Table started but not finished (see comments in function)
		+	range search for B tree (use cursor and get next or something)
	+	Implement timer
		+	Timer is to be displayed after a query 
=============================================================

	-	Implement Index File
		- Implement second "reversed" database where key/data pairs are reversed
			- Create this database while creating the initial database
			- Implement logic to properly handle duplicate keys as this is possible in this scenario in retrieveWithDataFromIndex()
	-	redirect output to answers file as specified

	-	Write-up
	-	Final check to make sure we havent missed anything!
