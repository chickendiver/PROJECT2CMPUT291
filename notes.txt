Hash Table:
	- modify given python program to work with hashtable
	- perform tests such that data can be entered and retrieved reliably
	- Determine whether how to retrieve key from data
		- this will either be with a second reverse hash table or by searching the entire hash table for the data
	- determine how to "properly" get runtime diagnostics for program. make sure all input and output is formatted as required. 

	- Merge with Bradley and decide what table does what better
	- Design a combination table
